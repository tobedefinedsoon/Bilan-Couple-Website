  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Will my partner see my answers?",
      "answer": "No, never. Your individual answers are strictly private and protected by server-side security rules. Your partner can NEVER see them. This is key to honest preparation. Only action items created together are visible to both."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Does this replace couples therapy?",
      "answer": "No. Couple Check-In is a prevention and maintenance tool for couples who are doing well and want to stay that way. If you're in crisis or significant conflict, we recommend consulting a professional. The app can be an excellent complement between therapy sessions."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Why quarterly and not monthly or weekly?",
      "answer": "The quarterly rhythm is frequent enough to catch small issues before they grow, but spaced enough to see real progress and avoid daily check-in fatigue. It's a ritual you'll look forward to, not a chore."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How does the two-pass system work?",
      "answer": "Each question is addressed twice: first one partner shares their prepared answer, then the other. Then roles reverse. This system ensures every voice is heard equally, without anyone dominating the conversation."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What happens if we don't finish a session?",
      "answer": "No worries! You can pick up exactly where you left off. The app saves your progress automatically. Take your time — some couples do their session across multiple sittings."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Does the subscription cover both partners?",
      "answer": "Yes! One purchase gives access to both partners. You don't need two subscriptions. It's $10/year for the whole couple."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can cancel your subscription anytime from your App Store or Google Play account settings. No commitment, no penalty."
